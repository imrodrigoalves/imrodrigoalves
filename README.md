## Hi there 👋

🌍 I'm Rodrigo, a tech enthusiast dedicated to online privacy and security. With over half a decade of experience in software development, APIs, and SaaS solutions, I thrive on creating innovative and efficient solutions.

⚡️ Fun Fact: I embarked on my tech journey at the young age of 9, setting up my first LAMP server to host a custom version of the online game Habbo.
